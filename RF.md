Prediction of diabetes using the Random Forest

Dataset included 9 Features and 768 samples.
Features are Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin,BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome.
The 'Outcome' is a person who is diabetic or not.
The model will be a binary classification.
The value of some feature(BloodPressure,Glucose, SkinThickness, Insulin) is zero that is impossible.
