# MachineLearning-SupervisedLearning_Classification
Prediction of diabetes using the Random Forest

The dataset included 9 Features and 768 samples.

Features are Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome.

The 'Outcome' is a person who is diabetic or not.

The model will be a binary classification.

The value of some features (BloodPressure, Glucose, SkinThickness, Insulin) is zero which is impossible so you have to tackle this problem.
